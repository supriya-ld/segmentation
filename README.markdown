Segmentation
============

This project was an assignment of the Computer Graphics course at [ITBA] [1] in 2008. See copyright notes at the bottom.

It features an [**image segmentation**] [2] framework written in Java, using standard libraries (no external dependencies required).

See instructions below on how to run.

Features
---------

  - 3 segmentation algorithms: K-means, Split & merge and Antipole tree
  - 3 segmentation features: by color, by color histogram (RGB or HSB) and by spacial color histogram
  - Filters: Blur, sharpen, equalization, resolution reduction, max, min, max-min, midpoint, average
  - Zooming
  - Panels for comparing original and segmented image, in vertical or horizontal layout

File contents
